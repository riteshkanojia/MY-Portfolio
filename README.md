## About Me

I’m Abhishek Kanojia (also known as Ritesh), a passionate and performance-driven Digital Marketing Specialist with over 3 years of hands-on experience in growing websites from scratch to thousands of clicks, leads, and conversions.

I believe in data-backed strategies, creative problem-solving, and full-funnel marketing to deliver real business results.

I specialize in SEO, Google Ads, Meta Ads, WordPress website design, and local SEO optimization. From technical SEO audits to high-ROAS ad campaigns, I help businesses generate traffic, drive conversions, and improve online visibility.

I’ve consistently grown websites from 0 to over 1,000+ daily clicks, achieving 30,000–50,000 impressions and strong engagement on both organic and paid channels. My local SEO efforts have also driven 300–500 calls per month through Google Business Profiles.
